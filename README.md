# Music Visualizer Project

This project is a music visualizer that reflects the different components of a song through dynamic visual elements. Using the song "Watermelon Sugar" by Harry Styles, the visualizer separates the audio into drums, bass, vocals, and other outputs to create a vibrant and interactive visual display.

## How to Run the Project

To view and interact with the music visualizer, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone [repository URL]`.

2. **Open the Project Folder:**
   - Navigate to the project folder using your file explorer.

3. **Open in Visual Studio Code:**
   - Right-click on the `index.html` file and select "Open with Live Server" (if you have the Live Server extension installed). Alternatively, you can open the `index.html` file directly in your browser.

## Interacting with the Visualizer

Once the project is running, follow these instructions to interact with the visualizer:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - When you first open the visualizer, you will see the visual elements but no music will be playing.
   - Hover your mouse over the top left corner of the screen to reveal a pop-up with four sliders and a button labeled "Stop Music".

2. **Stopping the Music:**
   - Click the "Stop Music" button first. This will prepare the visualizer for interaction.

3. **Adjusting the Sliders:**
   - Use the four sliders to see how each sound component (drums, bass, vocals, and others) affects the visualizer.
   - The sliders control the oscillation of the four inner circles, each colored in watermelon hues.

4. **Starting the Music:**
   - Click the "Start Music" button to begin playing the song "Watermelon Sugar" by Harry Styles.
   - The visualizer will start responding to the music, with the outer circle oscillating according to the overall output of the song.
   - The particles on the outside will increase in speed based on the bass and volume, creating the sensation of traveling through space.

## Features

- **Dynamic Visual Elements:**
  - The visualizer reacts to different components of the song, creating an engaging visual experience.
  - Four inner circles oscillate based on the individual sound components (drums, bass, vocals, and others).
  - The outer circle oscillates in response to the song as a whole.
  - Particles around the visualizer speed up according to the bass and volume, enhancing the immersive feel.
